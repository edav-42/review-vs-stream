## Research topic

The disconnection between critic reviews and actual sales and streams exists in every area of art.
We are interested in the relationships between reviews and streams of top-reviewed/streamed tracks and albums.
Specifically, we consider three dimensions of ranking:

1. Critic reviews: reviews written by professional critics;
2. User ratings: aggregated ratings assigned by general users;
3. Streams: number of streams on streaming services.

Intuitively, music with higher reviews should be streamed more. However, we can see a lot of hit songs with bad reviews, and many highly acclaimed albums that most people have never heard of.

Therefore, exploring and visualizing the relationships between reviews and streams, together with some other dimensions, will give us some insights into how these systems work.
At the application level, the revealed information can help build better recommendation systems, promotion strategies, etc.
