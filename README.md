# Review vs Stream

This is the repository of our EDAV final project: [Review vs Stream](https://edav-42.github.io/review-vs-stream).

In this project, we explore the relationship between the review and stream. Meanwhile, we also attempt to give some answers to these two questions:

- What makes an album highly/lowly rated?
- What makes an album popular/unpopular?

Bearing these questions in mind, we explore and visualize the data from Metacritic (for critic reviews), Rate Your Music (for user ratings), and Spotify (for popularity).

Now please join us on this wild music EDAV journey!
